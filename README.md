## ⚙️ Tech Stack

This project will use the following tools and technologies:

* **Python** – Data processing and scripting
* **SQL** – Data querying and transformations
* **Git / GitHub / GitHub Actions** – Version control and CI/CD
* **Docker / Docker Compose** – Containerization and environment setup
* **Apache Airflow (can use prefect but warehouse evolve around  tags/dags)** – Workflow orchestration
* **DuckDB** – Embedded analytics database
* **Metabase** – Data visualization and BI

## 📌 Action Plan
This project will serve as a structured playground to experiment with modern data engineering and analytics practices. The focus areas will include:

- Containerization skeleton (for different tech stack)  
- Implementation and local testing for the skeleton of the tech stack  
- Analysis of dataset through Metabase and direct inferences  
- Data dictionary understanding – Dimensional/Fact or DL/Layer, or relevant feasible requirements (modelling understanding)  
- Airflow infra setup  
- Governance tags inside Airflow  
- DuckDB infra setup  
- Metabase report (KPIs on top of SQL queries or required assignment reports)  
- Recreatable reports/dashboards that can be manipulated or viewed by end users  

# TODO: 
-> action plan first (write on the readme what an action plan would be and then move to a refined flow.)
